In the above neural network, we have 3 neural network.

  1. Input layer
  2. Hidden layer
  3. Output layer
 
 w1,w2,w3,w4,w5,w6,w7,w8 are the weights.
 
 In this network we have 2 output. So we have 2 Errors E1 and E2.
 
 E1 and E2 are L2 Error.
 
 We use sigmoid function in hidden layer and output layer  for introducing non linearity.
 
 In the excel sheet, each weight , output, error,error gradient with respect to each weight is calculated.
 
 For each epoch weight is modified such that the total error decreases
 
 New weights values are calculated from the previousweight value , learning rate and error gradient.
